/**
 *
 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students

            SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)

            SELECT * FROM teachers WHERE subject = "5"; (5 is the course_id for math)

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher

            SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name
            FROM students
            INNER JOIN teachers_students
            ON teachers_students.student_id = students.id
            INNER JOIN teachers
            ON teachers.id = teachers_students.teacher_id
            WHERE teachers.last_name = 'Bird';


 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject

            SELECT c.name, s.first_name, s.last_name
            FROM courses c
            JOIN students_courses sc
            ON c.id = sc.course_id
            JOIN students s
            ON sc.student_id = s.id
            WHERE course_id = '3'
            ORDER BY name

 *          e. update a record in the student table

            UPDATE `college`.`students` SET `email` = 'katenix@codingnomads.co' WHERE (`id` = '5');

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table

            UPDATE `college`.`teachers` SET `first_name` = 'alice', `last_name` = 'cooper' WHERE (`id` = '3');
 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
