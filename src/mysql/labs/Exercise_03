*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day

        SELECT * FROM airtravel.flight WHERE FlightDate = "2022-10-10";

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day

        //I did something similar, but my data was different so I just went with it.

        SELECT * FROM airtravel.flight WHERE origin = "21" and destination = "22"
        or origin = "47" and destination = "50";

*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today

        **

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight

        Select flight.FlightNum, flight.Origin, flight.Destination, flight.FlightDepartTime, flight.FlightDate, passenger.LastName
        FROM flight
        JOIN tickets t ON flight.FlightNum = ticket.FlightNum
        JOIN passengers p ON ticket.Passenger_ID = passenger.PassengerID
        WHERE passenger.PassengerID = "2000";

*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday


*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year


*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year


*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports


*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights


*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight


*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
