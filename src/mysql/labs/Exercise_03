*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day

        SELECT * FROM airtravel.flight WHERE FlightDate = "2022-10-10";

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day

        //I did something similar, but my data was different so I just went with it.

        SELECT * FROM airtravel.flight WHERE origin = "21" and destination = "22"
        or origin = "47" and destination = "50";

*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today

      SELECT passenger.FirstName, passenger.LastName, passenger.DOB, passenger.PhoneNum, passenger.Email
      FROM passenger p
      JOIN ticket t ON p.TicketID = t.TicketID
      JOIN flight f ON t.FlightNum = f.FlightNum
      WHERE f.FlightNum = '2005'
        AND f.origin = '21'
        AND f.destination = '61'
        AND DATE(f.FlightDate) = CURDATE(); // This part will check for any flights that happen *today*
        //But there are none in my data. So without this, it will actually find something.


*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight

        Select flight.FlightNum, flight.Origin, flight.Destination, flight.FlightDepartTime, flight.FlightDate, passenger.LastName
        FROM flight
        JOIN tickets t ON flight.FlightNum = ticket.FlightNum
        JOIN passengers p ON ticket.Passenger_ID = passenger.PassengerID
        WHERE passenger.PassengerID = "2000";

*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday

        SELECT passenger.FirstName, passenger.LastName, passenger.DOB, passenger.PhoneNum, passenger.Email
        FROM passenger p
        JOIN ticket t ON p.TicketID = t.TicketID
        JOIN flight f ON t.FlightNum = f.FlightNum
        WHERE f.FlightNum = '2005'
          AND p.PassengerId = '2019'
          AND DATE(f.FlightDate) = DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);


*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_flights FROM flight
        WHERE origin = '1'
          AND destination = '21'
          AND YEARWEEK(FlightDate) = YEARWEEK(NOW());

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_flights FROM flight
        WHERE origin = '1'
          AND destination = '21'
          AND YEAR(FlightDate) = YEAR(NOW())
          AND MONTH(FlightDate) = MONTH(NOW());

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_flights FROM flight
        WHERE origin = '1'
          AND destination = '21'
          AND YEAR(FlightDate) = YEAR(NOW());

*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_passengers FROM flight
        JOIN ticket ON flight.FlightNum = ticket.FlightNum
        JOIN passenger ON ticket.Passenger_ID = passenger.PassengerId
        WHERE flight.origin = '1'
            AND flight.destination = '21'
            AND flight.FlightDate = CURDATE();

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_passengers FROM flight
        JOIN ticket ON flight.FlightNum = ticket.FlightNum
        JOIN passenger ON ticket.Passenger_ID = passenger.PassengerId
        WHERE flight.origin = '1'
            AND flight.destination = '21'
            AND YEARWEEK(flight.FlightDate, 1) = YEARWEEK(CURDATE(), 1);

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_passengers FROM flight
        JOIN ticket ON flight.FlightNum = ticket.FlightNum
        JOIN passenger ON ticket.Passenger_ID = passenger.PassengerId
        WHERE flight.origin = '1'
            AND flight.destination = '21' AND MONTH(flight.FlightDate) = MONTH(CURDATE())
            AND YEAR(flight.FlightDate) = YEAR(CURDATE());

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_passengers FROM flight
        JOIN ticket ON flight.FlightNum = ticket.FlightNum
        JOIN passenger ON ticket.Passenger_ID = passenger.PassengerId
        WHERE flight.origin = '1'
            AND flight.destination = '21'
            AND YEAR(flight.FlightDate) = YEAR(CURDATE());


*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports

        INSERT INTO flight (FlightNum, origin, destination, FlightDate, PlaneId, FlightDepartTime)
        VALUES ('50123', '1', '21', '2023-04-18', 6024, '10:45:00');


*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights

        INSERT INTO passenger (FirstName, LastName, DOB, PhoneNum, Email, TicketID)
        VALUES ('Jyrki', 'Tavastia', '1990-01-12', '5558476', 'jyrkitavastia@email.com');

        INSERT INTO ticket (FlightNum, TicketID)
        VALUES ('2005', '1021');


*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight

        UPDATE `airtravel`.`passenger` SET `MealPreference` = 'Vegetarian'
        WHERE (`PassengerID` = '2019')
        AND (`TicketID` = '1005');


*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
