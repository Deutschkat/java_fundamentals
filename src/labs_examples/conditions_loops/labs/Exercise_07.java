/**
 * Conditions and Loops Exercise 7: First vowel
 *
 *      Take in a word from the user and using a "while" loop, find the first vowel in the word.
 *      Once you find the vowel, print out the word and the first vowel.
 *
 *      Hints:
 *          - there are a few helpful methods in the String class called length(), charAt() and indexOf()
 *          - you'll likely want to use a String that contains all the vowels:
 *              - ie: String vowels = "aeiou";
 *
