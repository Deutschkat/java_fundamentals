/**
 * Conditions and Loops Exercise 5: Calculator
 *
 *      Take two numbers from the user, an upper and lower bound. Using a "for-loop", calculate the sum
 *      of numbers from the lower bound to the upper bound. Also, calculate the average of numbers.
 *      Print the results to the console.
 *
 *      For example, if a user enters 1 and 100, the output should be:
 *
 *      The sum is: 5050
 *      The average is: 50.5
