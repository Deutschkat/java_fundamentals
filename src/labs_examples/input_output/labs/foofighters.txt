The Sky Is A Neighborhood

The sky is a neighborhood
So keep it down
Heart is a storybook
A star burned out
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't make a sound
Lights comin' up ahead
Don't look now
The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
Don't look now
Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Mind is a battlefield
All hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left
Whose side you're on?
Thoughts like a minefield
I'm a tickin' bomb
Maybe you should watch your step
Don't get lost
The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
Don't get lost
Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
The sky is a neighborhood
Heart is a storybook
A star burned out
Somethin' comin' up ahead
Don't look now
Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow (the sky is a neighborhood)
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
The sky is a neighborhood
