/**
 * Input/Output Exercise 1: File encryption
 *
 *      -Using the BufferedReader, read a file character by character and write an encrypted version to a new file.
 *      -For example, change every 'a' to '-' and every 'e' to '~' .
 *      -Make sure you close the connections to both files.
 *
 *      BONUS: If you are feeling bold, read back the encrypted file using the BufferedReader and
 *      print out the unencrypted version. Does it match the original file?
