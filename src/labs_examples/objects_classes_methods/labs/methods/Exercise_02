For each POJO you created to complete the previous Airplane exercise, please change all the instance variables in each
class to "private". Then, create getter and setter methods (for each instance variable) in each class you created for
the airplane exercise. Also, create a toString() method in each POJO. Once complete, demonstrate getting and setting
those variables from the class in which you composed the Airplane object, as well as invoking their toString() methods.
