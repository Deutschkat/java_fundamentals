1) Demonstrate the three forms of Polymorphism:
    - Overloading
    - Overriding
    - Interfaces

2) Demonstrate the three forms of polymorphism again - but in a new set of classes. We want to lock this in.
Challenge yourself. Build something you're proud of. *Repeat step 1*

3) Demonstrate using an interface as an instance variable - have a constructor that takes in the interface as a
parameter. Also have a setter that allows you to update the interface object. Through code, demonstrate that you
understand how we can use Interfaces as dependencies (instance variables) and how useful and flexible they make our
application.
        *Make interface- generic.
        *Class- generic (myClass).
        *Polymorphism dependency /motorized transport example.
