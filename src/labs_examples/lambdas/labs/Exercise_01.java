/**
 * Lambdas Exercise 1:
 *
 *      1) Demonstrate creating a functional interface with an abstract method that takes no parameters and returns void
 *      (Check)
 *
 *      2) Implement the previous functional interface with a lambda expression and use it. Also demonstrate creating
 *          an anonymous inner class from this interface.
 *      (Check)
 *
 *      3) Demonstrate creating a functional interface with an abstract method that takes 1 parameter and returns a
 *          value of the same type as the parameter
 *      (Check)
 *
 * 4) Implement the previous functional interface with a lambda expression and use it. Also demonstrate creating
 *          an anonymous inner class from this interface.
 *      (Check)
 *
 *      5) Demonstrate creating a functional interface with an abstract method that takes 2 parameters and returns a
 *          value
 *      (Check)
 *
 * 6) Implement the previous functional interface with a lambda expression and use it. Also demonstrate creating
 *          an anonymous inner class from this interface.
 *      (Check)
 *
 * 7) Demonstrate the use of at least two built-in functional interfaces from the java.util.function package.
