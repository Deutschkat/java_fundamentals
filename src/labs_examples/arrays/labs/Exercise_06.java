/**
 *  Reversing an array in place
 *
 *
 *      This is a very common interview challenge.
 *
 *      Using a for loop, please demonstrate how to reverse the nums[] array in place using only one extra variable. Please note,
 *      you cannot use a second array and you cannot instantiate any new variables in the class below.
 *
 *      Hint: you have two index
