/**
 *      LinkedLists - Exercise_02
 *
 *      Write your own custom LinkedList class. Although it can mimic the CustomLinkedList
 *      class we used here, it must be entirely unique. Please also add at least two
 *      additional helper methods that you think could be useful. Refer to Java's built-in
 *      LinkedList class for inspiration. Your new LinkedList class should ONLY allow users
 *      to add and remove elements from the front of the list AND the end of the list.
 *      Also, instead of using the index in the get() and remove() methods, these methods should
 *      get() and remove() based by the Node's value, not it's index.
