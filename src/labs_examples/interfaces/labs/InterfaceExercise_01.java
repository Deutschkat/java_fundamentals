/**
 * Interfaces Exercise 1:
 *
 *      1) Write an interface with at least three methods. Write two classes that implement the
 *          interface in different ways.
 *      2) Write a class that extends one of the classes from the previous step. Override the methods in
 *          the parent class.
 *
 *      NOTE: We encourage you to be creative and try to think of an example of your own for this
 *       exercise but if you are stuck, some ideas include:
 *
 *       - A Vehicle interface, that is advanced by a Tractor class and a Scooter class. Two of the methods could be
 *          turnOn() and brake().
 *       - A PersonalDevice interface that is advanced by a iPad class and a Computer class. Two of the methods could be
 *          playMusic() and turnOff().
