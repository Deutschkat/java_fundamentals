Building off the previous classes we created in Exercise_01 and Exercise_02

1) In the Deck.java class, create a method that will populate the Card[] with 52 unique Card object. The cards
should mimic an actual card deck. It should contain four aces (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs), four 2's
(spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs), four 3's (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs), ... up through Jacks, Queens and Kings

2) Create a deal() method that will take in a Player object and "deal" that player a random card out of the deck. To get
the random card, generate a random number between 1 and 52 (inclusive). Then check the ArrayList of Integers to make sure
that random number is not in there. If it is, that means the card has already been drawn. You need to generate new random
numbers until you find a card that has not been drawn. If/when the random number has not yet been played add the card at the index
of random num from the Cards[] to the player's "Hand" ArrayList, then add that random number to the ArrayList<Integer>
called usedCards in the Deck class. This usedCards arraylist tracks the cards that have already been dealt.

3) In the Hand class create a method that will return the score of the hand. The hand is an arraylist of Card objects.
An ace is worth one, a 2 is worth two, a 3 is worth three, ... a jack is worth 10, a queen is worth 11,
a king is worth 12.

4) In the Hand class, create a method that will return true if the hand value is greater than 21 and false if the hand
value is less than 21

5) In the Player class, create a method named computerAI that will return true if the computer player wants another card.
It will return false is the computer player does not want another card. If the computer player's hand currently has a
value less than 16 it will want another card. If the hand value is greater than or equal to 16 the computer will not
want another card.
